# FlutterBeam (Inspired by Silicon Valley)

This app is based on the moustache app that FlutterBeam was working on in the TV show Silicon Valley. It is like photo booth, but it adds realistic moustaches to your face. The moustaches morph to your face, and they scale as you move away from the camera. There are 3 default moustaches you can switch between.

Only one person per frame, but the moustache will instantly switch off as people leave and enter the frame.

Once you run the app, you can use the green toolbar to select and change your moustaches. You can also press the space key to take a picture and save it to your desktop (Only on mac computers), or you can press the 'r' key to reset the facial tracking if it stops working properly for whatever reason.

Have fun!
